<b>Introduction</b><br>
Since Covid-19 pandemic started, the entire world has acknowledged the fact that these specific situations require swift and continuous application of special measures to contain the spread of the virus and restore people’s everyday life. The quickness, and the number of people that apply the measures is fundamental to reduce the multiple losses induced by the presence of the virus, and the world itself has shown how different approaches can bring very different outcomes. The idealization of a virtual authority that tries to rationally apply the above considerations sparked the idea of Reversed Plague Inc. The project consists of an agent (that we can idealize as “the government”) that applies actions w.r.t. a population, in order to eradicate the virus and its effects on the aforementioned community. The representation of the world implemented by the project is obviously relaxed in many ways, considering the uncertainty related to human (and pathogenic) behaviour, but has the exact same goal to reach. Also, a lot of assumptions are made in order to keep the framework simple, but not so as to prevent a possible extension.
